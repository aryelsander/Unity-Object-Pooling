# Unity Object Pooling

Simple solution for creating object pooling in unity.

# How to Use:

## 1 Create a new empty GameObject in your scene.                                                                                                  ## 2 Add the ObjectPooling Script.                                                                                                                                                ## 3 Set the List of pool objects size and fill the fields.
##   3.1 Object Name is used in SpawnObjectPool Method.
##   3.2 Object Prefab need a interface IPoolObject interface.
##   3.3 Max Objects In Scene creates initial prefabs and set the maximum quantity.
##   3.4 Dynamic size allows more on-demand prefab objects.
##  4 Use the method SpawnObjectPool to Get Spawn Objects.
##   4.1 If reach maximum objects and dynamic size is not enabled, you will not be able to use more objects until one of them is disabled again.
##  5 OnSpawn() method is call when the prefab is actived

# Example:

ï»¿using UnityEngine;
public class Test: MonoBehaviour
{
  private void Start()
  {
    ObjectPooling.Instance.SpawnObjectPool("Ball",transform.position,quaternion.identity);
  }
}
